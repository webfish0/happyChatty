- Automatic reconnection handling
- JSON-based event structure
- Performance-optimized message handling

### Facial Expression System
- Emotion mapping to facial parameters
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Automatic blinking animations
- Emotion category color coding

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the system with dashboard
python main.py --dashboard

# Access dashboard at http://localhost:8080
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# List available audio devices
python main.py --list-devices

# Start with specific device
python main.py --device 1

# Custom dashboard port
python main.py --dashboard --dashboard-port 9090
```

## Testing Verification

2. Multi-language support
3. Advanced analytics and reporting
4. Export capabilities for conversation data
5. Customizable dashboard layouts

### Performance Optimizations
1. Memory usage optimization
2. CPU efficiency improvements
3. Network bandwidth reduction
4. Caching strategies for repeated utterances

## Conclusion

The conversation sentiment analysis dashboard has been successfully implemented and deployed with full functionality. The critical macOS compatibility issue has been resolved, ensuring the system works reliably across all platforms. The dashboard provides real-time visualization of conversation sentiment with animated speaker avatars, comprehensive analytics, and robust performance monitoring.
